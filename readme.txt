* UPDATE: Changed product price calculation due to changes in WooCommerce itself -- this led to **new required versions** for this plugin: **at least WordPress 3.3 and WooCommerce 1.4** or higher (Note: If you still have WooCommerc 1.3.x running then use version 1.0 of the Delivery Notes plugin!)

* UPDATE: Custom fields on settings page now accept proper `img` tags, so you can add logo images or such via HTML IMG tag (for example: `<img src="your-image-url" width="100" height="100" alt="Logo" title="My Shop" />`)
